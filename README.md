# HTML - CSS
> ## Dropbox Homepage Prototype
---
## Scope:
Reproduce the Dropbox.com webpage layout as closely as possible.

## Development:
1. Setup the basic structure of the page through the use of geometric shapes with fixed dimensions;
2. Divide the `style.css` in more `.css` files according to the different sections of `html`;
3. Setup a `utils.css` to facilitate the `html` writing process;
4. Fill the different sections one by one using debug lines to make sure of correct functioning;
5. Inspect the entire sections, trying to avoid `html-css` code redundancy;
6. Edit the already written `html-css`code trying to make the webpage at least a little bit responsive;
7. Complete the exercise bonus (not mandatory).

## Personal Consideration:
The exercise, thanks to a proficient explaination of both teacher and tutors results less complex. The toughest part has been of the entire exercise has been facing a large amount of code, both `html`and `css` and trying to manage the code written the days before. I'm not completely satisfied of the final results, but i won't give up on this.
